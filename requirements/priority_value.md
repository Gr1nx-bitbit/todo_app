# How Priorities Should be Scaled (According to Me)
I don't want the priority counts (PCs) to be crazy high so I want to put some restrictions on how they can grow. First off, **the max amount that a PC should ever be scaled by is:** `5`. I'll set a limit on this and try to make it so that the scalars are never more than 5. Scalars MUST also be greater than 1. I know it's probably not the best naming convention but the `Scalar` variant will only be used to scale the points ADDED to the priority count. I also want to limit the exponent value since that can get way out of hand. I want the highest exponent to be `1.5`. We have to keep track of what the base is though since we'll be calculating the priority count off of it. We'll also only set a new value when the frequency is satisfied. Ok, we'll work on this more some other day.
